# Enhanced Testing Strategy for Deploy-to-Prod Pipeline

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy embedded into the `deploy-to-prod.yml` workflow, providing environment-specific test cases that ensure reliable deployments across dev, qa, and prod environments.

## 🧪 Testing Architecture

### Test Categories by Environment

#### DEV Environment Tests
- **Purpose**: Basic functionality validation and rapid feedback
- **Test Scope**: Content validation, basic performance, security headers
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Response time < 3.0s, basic security headers present

#### QA Environment Tests
- **Purpose**: Integration testing and pre-production validation
- **Test Scope**: Stricter performance, comprehensive security, load testing
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Response time < 2.5s, all security headers, 10 concurrent requests

#### PROD Environment Tests
- **Purpose**: Production readiness and business critical validation
- **Test Scope**: Business flows, concurrent users, comprehensive monitoring
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Response time < 2.0s, 20 concurrent requests, business flow validation

## 📋 Test Case Categories

### 1. Application Content Validation
```yaml
# Validates core application content
- Home page contains "AWS ECS Demo"
- About page contains "About"
- Both pages render correctly
```

### 2. Performance Testing
```yaml
# Environment-specific performance requirements
- DEV: < 3.0s response time
- QA: < 2.5s response time  
- PROD: < 2.0s average response time (5 samples)
```

### 3. Security Headers Validation
```yaml
# Progressive security validation
- DEV: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- QA: + X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy
- PROD: + Content-Security-Policy (complete OWASP compliance)
```

### 4. Load Testing
```yaml
# Concurrent request handling
- DEV: N/A (basic functionality focus)
- QA: 10 concurrent requests
- PROD: 20 concurrent requests + concurrent user simulation
```

### 5. ECS Service Health
```yaml
# Infrastructure validation
- Running tasks match desired tasks
- Task count > 0
- Service ARN validation (PROD only)
```

### 6. Business Critical Testing (PROD Only)
```yaml
# End-to-end business flow validation
- User journey timing
- Concurrent user simulation
- System responsiveness under load
```

## 🔍 Test Implementation Details

### Content Validation Tests
```bash
# Home page validation
if curl -s "http://$ALB_DNS/" | grep -q "AWS ECS Demo"; then
  echo "✅ Home page content validated"
else
  echo "❌ Home page content missing or incorrect"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Average response time calculation (PROD)
total_time=0
for i in {1..5}; do
  response_time=$(curl -o /dev/null -s -w '%{time_total}' "http://$ALB_DNS/")
  total_time=$(echo "$total_time + $response_time" | bc -l)
done
avg_time=$(echo "$total_time / 5" | bc -l)
```

### Security Header Tests
```bash
# Comprehensive security header validation
security_headers=("X-Frame-Options" "X-Content-Type-Options" "X-XSS-Protection" "Referrer-Policy" "Content-Security-Policy")
for header in "${security_headers[@]}"; do
  if echo "$headers" | grep -q "$header"; then
    echo "✅ $header header present"
  else
    echo "❌ $header header missing"
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Concurrent request testing
failed_requests=0
for i in {1..20}; do
  if ! curl -f -s "http://$ALB_DNS/health" > /dev/null; then
    failed_requests=$((failed_requests + 1))
  fi
done
```

## 🚀 Business Critical Testing (PROD)

### User Journey Simulation
```bash
# Timed business flow
start_time=$(date +%s)
# ... execute business flow ...
end_time=$(date +%s)
total_time=$((end_time - start_time))
```

### Concurrent User Simulation
```bash
# Background processes for concurrent users
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -s "http://$ALB_DNS/" > /dev/null &
done
wait
```

### Multi-Environment Validation
```bash
# Final validation across all environments
environments=("dev" "qa" "prod")
for env in "${environments[@]}"; do
  # Validate each environment is healthy
done
```
